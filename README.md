### Abstract
Due to advancements in urbanization, the demand for text-spraying has notably surged. This technique is crucial in advertising, slogan display, and venue decoration, making it vital for government, business owners, event planners, as well as urban developers. However, current 
solutions for the text-spraying process——manual labor and robotic vehicle applications, present several notable challenges.

For manual labor, the chemicals contained within the paint can pose significant health risks to human operators and the quality of the output is often heavily reliant on the operator's skill and physical condition. Robotic paint-spraying systems, while mitigating some of these issues, have their own limitations. They fail to meet the needs for personalized text-spraying tasks, and their size and weight restrict their flexibility and usability to certain contexts. Thus, the aim of this project is to develop a text-spraying mobile car to improve health safety, ensure high-quality outcomes, cater to individualized text-spraying requirements, and enhance operational flexibility. 

### Procedure
1. First, we redesign and assemble the paint spraying module for precise control of flow. Second, we develop the motion platform for 
consistency and quality in spraying. 
2. Then, we create the Dot Matrix Algorithm for precise text spraying to enhance specialized needs. 
3. Finally, we establish the mobility unit for enhanced operational capabilities. 
4. After completing these tasks, our system now performs the following functions:
   - (1) automatically achieving precise nozzle location
   - (2) controlling the flow and amount of paint output
   - (3) spraying in accordance with input text
   - (4) moving horizontally to enable multiple spraying. 
  ### Outcomes
  In conclusion, our system can successfully achieve the text-spraying process, delivering high-quality results tailored to personalized needs, while minimizing health risks.  Furthermore, by proportionally scaling up the machinery, it can accomplish the precise spraying of more intricate patterns. This provides a more versatile and efficient tool to produce advertisements and artwork.
